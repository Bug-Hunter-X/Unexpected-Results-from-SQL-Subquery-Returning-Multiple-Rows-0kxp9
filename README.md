This repository contains examples of an SQL query that produces unexpected results due to a subquery returning multiple rows when only one is expected. The bug.sql file shows the erroneous query, while bugSolution.sql demonstrates the corrected version. The issue arises from the subquery not being properly constrained to ensure only a single row is returned. The solution involves adding a `LIMIT 1` clause or adjusting the `WHERE` clause of the subquery to ensure uniqueness.
